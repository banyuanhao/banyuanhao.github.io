  Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student in [UCLA Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/).

  I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2023 with a degree in Eletronic Engineering. At Tsinghua,  I was fortunate enough to do research at [TSAIL Lab](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

  Research: My research interests lie in generative models, in particular, video generative models and image generative models. I am also interested in optimizing GPU kernels for emerging applications, including sparse and recurrent neural networks.


Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
