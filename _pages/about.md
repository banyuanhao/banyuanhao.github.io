  I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in [UCLA Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/).

  I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2023 with a degree in Eletronic Engineering. At Tsinghua,  I was fortunate enough to do research at [TSAIL Lab](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)， where I worked with [Dr Yinpeng Dong](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml).

  Research: My research interests lie in generative models, in particular, video generative models and image generative models. 

I am currently an intern at Snap research working with Dr. Aliaksandr Siarohin and Dr. Sergey Tulyakov.

I am broadly interested in designing machine learning systems that can perceive the world as we humans do, which I believe is the cornerstone of achieving AGI. I have been working on generative AI (world models), object-centric learning (structured representation), and event-based vision (silicon retina).
