  Iâ€™m a second-year Ph.D. student in [UCLA Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/).

  I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2023 with a degree in Eletronic Engineering. At Tsinghua,  I was fortunate enough to do research at [TSAIL Lab](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

  Research: My research interests lie in generative models, in particular, video generative models and image generative models. 


I am a fourth-year PhD student in Toronto Intelligent Systems Lab (TISL) at the University of Toronto and affiliated with the Vector Institute. My advisor is Prof. Igor Gilitschenski. I am currently an intern at Snap research working with Dr. Aliaksandr Siarohin and Dr. Sergey Tulyakov. I was a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind with Dr. Thomas Kipf in Spring 2024.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, where I worked with Prof. Jiwen Lu. I spent an unforgettable summer in 2020 doing internship at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Leonidas J. Guibas.

I am broadly interested in designing machine learning systems that can perceive the world as we humans do, which I believe is the cornerstone of achieving AGI. I have been working on generative AI (world models), object-centric learning (structured representation), and event-based vision (silicon retina).
