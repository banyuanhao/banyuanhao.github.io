  I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in [UCLA Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/).
  I have the fortune to work with [Ruochen Wang](https://ruocwang.github.io/), [Prof. Boqing Gong](http://boqinggong.info/), [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/), and [Prof Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/).

  I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2023 with a degree in Eletronic Engineering. At Tsinghua,  I was fortunate enough to do research at [TSAIL Lab](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)， where I worked with [Dr Yinpeng Dong](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml).

  I am broadly interested in designing controllable generative models that align with human intentions and societal values, which I believe are fundamental to achieving AGI. I enjoy doing analysictal work on the mechanism of these generative models
  
  I have been working on generative AI (world models), object-centric learning (structured representation), and event-based vision (silicon retina).
