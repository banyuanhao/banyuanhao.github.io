  I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in [UCLA Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) advised by Professor [Cho-Jui Hsieh](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/).
  I have the fortune to work with [Ruochen Wang](https://ruocwang.github.io/), [Prof. Boqing Gong](http://boqinggong.info/), [Prof. Minhao Cheng](https://cmhcbb.github.io/), and [Prof Tianyi Zhou](https://tianyizhou.github.io/).

  I graduated from Tsinghua University in 2023 with a degree in Eletronic Engineering. At Tsinghua,  I was fortunate enough to do research at [TSAIL Lab](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)， where I worked with [Dr Yinpeng Dong](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~yinpeng/) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml).

  I am broadly interested in designing controllable generative models that align with human intentions and societal values, which I believe are fundamental to achieving AGI. I enjoy conducting analytical research on the mechanisms of these generative models, particularly focusing on the role of negative prompts and initial noise in image generation models, as well as the impact of positional embeddings in video diffusion models.

  Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/103CQYif895FwHpVLYQWXWdS-DP1zjTa4/view?usp=sharing). This site was last updated on December 17th, 2024.
